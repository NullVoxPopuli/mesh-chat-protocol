# Routing across the mesh network

In an ideal world, everyone would have a direct connection to everyone.
However, due to various firewalls and private networks, VPNs, etc -- We have to be able to relay messages from those who don't have a way to contact someone to those who do.
No intermediary / relay node will be able to read the message to the intended target, because only the intended target will have the decryption key. So there are no real incentives to any nodes going rogue and collecting all messages sent to them to be relayed.
